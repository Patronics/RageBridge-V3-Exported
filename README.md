# RageBridge-V3-Exports

Updated Revision of Charles Guan's RageBridge V2 with updated parts


This Repository is to archive progress done to reverse engineer the Rage Bridge V2 Board created by Charles Guan 

The board design has been tested and found to work to drive a 120lb combat robot's drive system.

### This fork aims to improve accessibility of the resources, by providing a PDF export of the schematic and PCB design, along with exported gerber files to enable manufacturing of the board for users without Fusion360
